        <h1>Introduction To DocuSign</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>DocuSign</b>&#160;is a web based application that allows users to send and sign documents electronically.&#160; The documents are stored in the cloud and can be accessed anytime from anywhere.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When sending documents for signature users can control who needs to sign and who can observe.</p>
        <p>In addition if there are multiple viewers or signers, users can control the order the document will be signed in.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Documents are sent for signature using an electronic <b>Envelope</b>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>DocuSign Envelopes</b> are similar to a paper envelope since it is used to "transmit" documents to a recipient.&#160; The key difference is that no physical media is needed since DocuSign transmits documents&#160;electronically.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note that an <b>Envelope</b> may contain one or more documents and can be sent&#160;to multiple recipients.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
